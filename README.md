# Gnuplot Robots

C++ project made for an university course in early 2017.

## Brief description

App lets you draw, move and rotate few robots on Gnuplot canvas. On that canvas there are also some obstacles. App detects collisions between robots and these obstacles and also has some additional options like translation of the whole drawing or getting each robot's path length. UI is an in-terminal menu, but canvas is shown in separate window.
